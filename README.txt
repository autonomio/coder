THIS PROJECT IS BASED ON https://buildasaasappwithflask.com/ , AN EXCELLENT COURSE TO BUILDING PYTHON FLASK APPLICATIONS BY NICK JANETAKIS


This was my first Flask project, and I made good decision to base it on the course. Nick provides excellent support for his courses, so if you
feel need to learn how to build this further or any other Flask application, I sincerely recommend his course.
